## Geolocation Wireless Sensor Network based system for wildlife tracking.

This project offers an alternative to current telemetry for wildlife tracking technologies, using a system based on collars with capabilities for geolocation, data storage and wireless mesh network communication. With these features, it is possible to gather information on the spatial and temporal location of each one of the monitored devices. This information, being shared across the network, provides backup and data access from any point of it, allowing an automatic and continuous remote information gathering in wildlife populations, in which, information of the movement of individuals is required to be obtained simultaneously.

Metodology consisted in hardware selection, implementation of communication protocols I2C, SPI, DigiMesh, and development of the hardware nodes based on the system requirements, which are, transmit power, gain antenna, positioning sensor, the control unit, data processing, and the wireless transmission.

The information on locations obtained through this system could be used to determine the movement patterns of wildlife, their distribution ranges and habitat use.
